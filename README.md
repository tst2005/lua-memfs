# lua-memfs

Why ?
=====

 * File-System consideration are as complicated as interested.
 * Lua don't have a standard (full featured) file system abstraction

Goal
====

 * Do a FS !
 * Defined a full featured API
 * bind the API on the true FS (with LFS), over tar file, over sqlite-fs, etc.
